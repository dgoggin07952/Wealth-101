# FastAPI Deployment Instructions

## The Problem
Your Replit deployment is configured for Streamlit but your app is FastAPI-based.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update .replit file
You need to manually edit the `.replit` file in your Replit editor:

**Change this line:**
```toml
run = ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "5000"]
```

**To this:**
```toml
run = ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]
```

### 2. Alternative: Use the new main.py
I've created a `main.py` that properly imports your FastAPI app. Use this command instead:
```toml
run = ["python", "main.py"]
```

### 3. Or replace .replit entirely
Copy the contents of `replit_fastapi.toml` to your `.replit` file.

## Files Created
- `main.py` - Proper FastAPI entry point
- `replit_fastapi.toml` - Complete FastAPI configuration

## Your FastAPI App Structure
```
├── main.py (FastAPI entry point)
├── backend/
│   └── app/
│       └── main.py (your FastAPI app)
├── frontend/ (React build served by FastAPI)
└── .replit (needs updating)
```

## Testing
After updating .replit, test locally:
```bash
python main.py
```

Your app should be accessible at the deployment URL with full FastAPI functionality.
