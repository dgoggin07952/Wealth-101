## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application supports two frontend implementations:

1. **Streamlit-based Frontend** (Python): Single-page application with embedded authentication and routing
2. **React-based Frontend** (JavaScript): Modern SPA with React Router for navigation

**Key Frontend Technologies:**
- React 18+ with modern hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- React Router for client-side routing
- Axios for API communication
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with FastAPI providing a RESTful API architecture:

**Core Components:**
- FastAPI application with modular router structure
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

**API Structure:**
- `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/wealth` - Wealth management endpoints
- `/api/assets` - Asset management endpoints
- `/api/analytics` - Dashboard analytics
- `/api/income` - Income tracking
- `/api/expenses` - Expense tracking
- `/api/milestones` - Financial goal tracking
- `/api/profile` - User profile management
- `/api/reports` - Report generation and PDF exports

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication
- User registration and login
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes with dependency injection
- Session management

### Wealth Management

- Asset allocation charts
- Financial health check reports
- PDF report generation
- Performance analytics

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via frontend
2. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Token stored in client for subsequent requests
4. Protected routes verify token before processing

### Wealth Data Flow
1. User inputs asset information through forms
2. Data validated using Pydantic models
3. SQLAlchemy ORM persists data to database
4. Analytics service processes data for dashboard
5. Chart data service generates visualization data
6. Frontend renders charts and summaries

### Report Generation Flow
1. User requests report through API
2. Backend aggregates user data from database
3. PDF generation service creates formatted reports
4. File returned as downloadable response

- Environment-based configuration for database and secrets
- JWT secret key configuration for security
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Database Strategy
- SQLAlchemy models with PostgreSQL backend
- Alembic for database migrations
- Connection pooling for performance
- Environment-based database URL configuration

### Security Measures
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt

- SQL injection prevention through ORM

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack Choice
**Problem**: Need for both rapid prototyping and production-ready application
**Solution**: Dual frontend approach with Streamlit for rapid development and React for production
**Rationale**: Streamlit allows quick feature validation while React provides better user experience and scalability

### API-First Design
**Problem**: Need for flexible frontend options and potential mobile app development
**Solution**: FastAPI backend with comprehensive REST API
**Rationale**: Enables multiple frontend implementations and future platform expansion

### Database Design
**Problem**: Complex financial data relationships and reporting requirements
**Solution**: Relational database with SQLAlchemy ORM
**Rationale**: Provides data integrity, complex queries, and easy relationship management

### Authentication Strategy
**Problem**: Secure user access and session management
**Solution**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
**Rationale**: Stateless authentication suitable for API architecture with strong security

### Modular Architecture
**Problem**: Code organization and maintainability
**Solution**: Separated concerns with service layer, API routes, and data models
**Rationale**: Improves code maintainability, testability, and team collaboration
