# DEPLOYMENT FIX - FastAPI ONLY

## Problem
Your .replit file is configured to run Streamlit, but your app is FastAPI-based.

## Solution
You need to edit your .replit file in the Replit editor:

**CHANGE THIS LINE (line 9):**
```toml
run = ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "5000"]
```

**TO THIS:**
```toml
run = ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Alternative Options
If the above doesn't work, try these alternatives:

**Option 1:**
```toml
run = ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Option 2:**
```toml
run = ["python", "-c", "from main import app; import uvicorn; uvicorn.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)"]
```

**Option 3:**
```toml
run = ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]
```

## Files Created
- `app.py` - Pure FastAPI entry point (NO STREAMLIT)
- `main.py` - Alternative FastAPI entry point

## Your Backend Status
- ✅ FastAPI backend is running on port 5000
- ✅ React frontend is being served correctly
- ✅ All API endpoints are working
- ❌ Deployment runner is trying to run Streamlit instead of FastAPI

## Test Locally
```bash
python app.py
```

Your WealthTracker Pro will work perfectly once you fix the deployment configuration!
