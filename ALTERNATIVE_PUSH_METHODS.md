# Alternative Methods to Push to New Repository

Since Git operations are restricted, here are alternative methods to get your WealthTracker Pro to the new repository:

## Method 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Go to your new repository**: https://github.com/dgoggin07952/Wealth-101
2. **Click "uploading an existing file"** or drag and drop
3. **Upload these key files**:
   - `main.py` (FastAPI entry point)
   - `app.py` (Alternative entry point)
   - `vercel.json` (Vercel configuration)
   - `api/index.py` (Serverless function)
   - Entire `backend/` folder
   - Entire `frontend/` folder
   - `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`

## Method 2: GitHub Desktop

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**
2. **Clone your new repository**: https://github.com/dgoggin07952/Wealth-101.git
3. **Copy all files** from current Replit project to cloned folder
4. **Commit and push** via GitHub Desktop

## Method 3: Create Archive and Upload

1. **Download project files** from Replit as ZIP

## Your Files Are Vercel-Ready

Your WealthTracker Pro includes all necessary files for Vercel deployment:
